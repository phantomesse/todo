This is a simple Todo app that is a proof-of-concept for an Angular Typescript
frontend with a Typescript Node backend. The frontend uses SCSS for organizing
CSS and the app uses both HTTP requests and Socket.IO to communicate between
the frontend and backend.

# TODO
* Connect frontend and backend somehow
* Upload to Heroku
* Send an HTTP request from backend to frontend
* Socket IO

## Start prod
```
npm run postinstall; npm start
```

## Development
```
npm install
```

```
npm run dev
```
